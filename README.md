# Inventory App

In this project, you'll design and create the structure of a Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products.  
The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

## What I learned? ##
This project is about combining various ideas and skills I’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Creating a SQLite table in your app
* Populating that table with new entries
* Modifying the entries
* Displaying the contents of the table to users.
* Storing information in a SQLite database
* Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
* Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
* Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
* Updating information based on user input
* Creating intents to other apps using stored information
